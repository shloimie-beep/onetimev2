# W12-100-13 Original Prompt

You are executing one parallel W12-100 launch-readiness lane in:

Repository: webcraft-media/onetimev2
Canonical starting commit:
0d8d7168f066668f035176d777bdaaa4dcc5accd

Do not start from main, PR #61, an individual W12 feature branch, or PR #72.
Fetch all refs and verify that the exact starting commit exists before creating work.

Create a new isolated git worktree and the branch specified by this lane. Do not reuse or modify another lane's worktree.

Required first reads:
1. AGENTS.md
2. ops/director/START-HERE.md
3. ops/director/PRODUCT-INVARIANTS.md
4. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/FINAL-REPORT.md
5. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/STATE.json
6. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/CAPABILITY-MATRIX.json
7. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/CANARY-REPORT.json
8. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/IMPORT-PREVIEW.json
9. ops/codex-runs/W12-99/ROLLBACK.md

Global safety contract:
- Do not deploy staging or production in this lane.
- Do not connect to or read private rows from the production database.
- Do not send email, WhatsApp, Telegram, provider webhooks, payments, posts, Zoom invitations, or external helper requests.
- Do not create, delete, upload, publish, or mutate provider resources.
- Never print, copy, screenshot, serialize, or commit secrets, database URLs, private destinations, private links, source rows, raw message bodies, student-sensitive data, tokens, or passwords.
- Use hashes, counts, statuses, synthetic fixtures, and redacted summaries for evidence.
- Keep BNA code, sessions, data, provider runtime, and branches out of this repository lane.
- Do not integrate W12-09 unless the lane explicitly says to assess it.
- Do not run repo-wide prettier --write or mass-format inherited files.
- Do not merge PRs, mark PRs ready, or alter production configuration.
- Stay inside the assigned ownership paths. When a required fix belongs to another lane, record it as a dependency instead of editing that lane's files.

Create:
ops/codex-runs/<LANE-ID>/ORIGINAL-PROMPT.md
ops/codex-runs/<LANE-ID>/STATE.json
ops/codex-runs/<LANE-ID>/FINAL-REPORT.md
ops/codex-runs/<LANE-ID>/RESUME.md
ops/codex-runs/<LANE-ID>/CHANGED-FILES.txt

STATE.json must classify every objective as:
- done
- already_satisfied
- blocked
- needs_operator_decision

For implementation lanes:
- Add focused automated tests.
- Run focused tests first.
- Then run secret scan, lint, typecheck, and all directly affected suites.
- Run broader gates where practical.
- Do not weaken an assertion or remove a safety check merely to get green.

Before completion:
1. Confirm git status is clean after commit.
2. Push the branch.
3. Open a draft PR against
   integration/w12-final-convergence-20260717T123715Z
4. Put exact tests, blockers, external actions count, and mutation count in the PR body.
5. External actions and production mutations must both be zero.
LANE-ID: W12-100-13
Branch: codex/w12-100-13-gamification-scope-assessment

Ownership:
- ops/codex-runs/W12-100-13/** only

This is a read-only decision lane. Do not cherry-pick or modify product source.

Audit PR #71 and compare its exact current head with W12-99 head
0d8d7168f066668f035176d777bdaaa4dcc5accd.

Produce:
- changed-file inventory
- migration and shared-hotspot inventory
- functional scope
- student-safety assessment
- parent/admin visibility assessment
- privacy implications
- accessibility implications
- manipulation/addiction-risk assessment
- public ranking/shame-state verification
- reward and point integrity rules
- merge conflict forecast
- test-gap analysis
- deployment/migration risk
- estimated convergence order

Return one recommendation:
- integrate in W12-100
- defer until after launch
- reject pending redesign
- needs operator decision

Do not treat "already implemented on a branch" as sufficient reason to include
it in the launch train.
