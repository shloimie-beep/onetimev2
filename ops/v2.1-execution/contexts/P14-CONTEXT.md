# P14 — Student Application and Isolation — Locked Context

**Outcome:** Implement the separate Student application, own-profile experience, navigation, account controls, and strict sibling/household isolation.

**Source package lock:** `10df0e699e9ebe88d8b9dd4a756f6110ed3292110ff138a6de5caf97f139ec3e` (digest of source `SHA256SUMS.txt`)  
**Reviewed repository head:** `73dda293079f602c83929d1bbccb8dd5b9d1a455`  
**Primary writer slots:** `STUDENT_APP`

This file is a generated, checksum-bound subset of the v2.1 source package. It reduces rereading; it does not override the source documents. If its digest matches the task packet and package lock, do not globally re-audit the repository or reconsider locked decisions.

## Task-specific instructions

- Apply the exact task packet and execution contract.

## Dependency gates

- Start after: `F03, F04, F07`
- Full merge after: `F03, F04, F07`
- Candidate integration partners (non-ordering): `P16, P21, P22, P23, P26`
- Candidate acceptance after: `None`

## Machine-enforced owned globs

- `apps/web/src/client/app/student/account/**`
- `apps/web/src/client/app/student/home/**`
- `apps/web/src/client/app/student/profile/**`
- `apps/web/src/client/app/student/shell/**`
- `apps/web/src/server/features/portals/student/**`
- `packages/contracts/src/portals/student/**`
- `packages/domain/src/portals/student/**`

Scope notes below explain intent but do not grant additional path authority:

- Student isolation focused tests
- steward requests for route/migration/registration changes

## Deliverables

- separate Student shell and profile
- self-only authorized data contract
- safe account/password controls
- sibling and cross-household denial

## Relevant locked decisions (4)

| Decision | Status | Exact decision |
|---|---|---|
| DEC-014 | LOCKED | Students never require or receive an email address. No Student is created as a HighLevel contact. |
| DEC-063 | LOCKED | The classroom is an embedded Zoom experience inside the authenticated Student portal. |
| DEC-111 | LOCKED | Student devices receive in-app notices relevant to the Student. |
| DEC-121 | INFERRED | Student lifecycle is `active` or `archived`. Archived Students retain history, cannot authenticate, and do not consume an active seat. |

## Cross-cutting invariants

- Exact assignable roles are `admin`, `parent`, and `student`.
- Students have username/password credentials and no required email; no Student is a GHL contact.
- A Parent never becomes a learner session; an adult learner uses a separate Student seat.
- One adult identity may own multiple independently billed households; authorization remains household-scoped.
- No preview/demo/test product lane, fictional customer, Class Helper, Buffer/social publisher, public WhatsApp assistant, or active Tisha funnel route.
- GHL is adult CRM/campaign/operator billing workflow; Stripe is financial truth; One Time stores a minimum verified access projection and never mutates financial objects.
- Email must complete launch workflows even while WhatsApp is dormant.
- Zoom and Vimeo bearers/URLs never appear in UI URLs, email, GHL, logs, handoffs, or evidence.
- Production evidence must bind one immutable candidate; each case uses only an environment allowed by its acceptance contract and records exact environment/runtime/deployment/provider identity. The 265 cases are not required to share one environment.
- Automated production-safety verification is required even though demo/test product surfaces are prohibited.
