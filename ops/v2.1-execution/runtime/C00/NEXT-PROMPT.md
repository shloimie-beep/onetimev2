Continue One Time v2.1 task C00 from its remote checkpoint.

Repository: shloimie-beep/onetimev2

Authoritative control ref: origin/codex/v21-control
Task packet: ops/v2.1-execution/tasks/C00.yaml

Fetch remote refs and require the exact remote control head. Read
`CONTROL-STATE.yaml` and resume its first incomplete bootstrap phase. Verify
`LOCKED-SHA256SUMS.txt`, the current control/runtime digests, and the active
C00 lease. Reject any live foreign lease or non-fast-forward collision.

Bootstrap is operational and autonomous native-subagent orchestration is
enabled. The root C00 agent alone dispatches workers; child workers never spawn
product writers or edit control state. F01's interface is integrated at
`80c281b7ae5826ed2c6abe95ba68a033ffa52174`; F01 acknowledged both I36
rejection results at `dc991ef901617cc6d7e4fe780c53b4833172a0a2` and waits
for F03's remaining auth-steward result. F07 remains independently verified
and `ready_for_review`. P31 is ancestry-integrated at merge commit
`42b09dc598e0dfc17ada53b441e4cd487e126573`, with I36's final metadata
checkpoint at exact integration head
`eefca0644e57dca48609682cbc3e1b01992d286d`.

F02's corrected exact checkpoint is
`e4673ff1c2e621e26ac93034be245b280c4da4fa`, backed by implementation
`191dac288ea1721bdc0252bd012060ca974d2242`, interface digest
`c03e01d7e16bdc252b9964f1acfc60d40e772de98776023c20f7589e467b5ccd`,
and migration-2234 checksum
`d1352c5e46ae56ca549c9939ef739923109b4a0ab04f0d4df00c04dca71ccb22`.
C00 independently verified and admitted it. I36 ancestry-merged F02 at
`e6b49dff79911f3f11b6d2c0ce6a9a52d50bf7f4` and published exact final
integration head `d8b35b2aaa0dc4b687b6e88192c7eac6222ecdec`; typecheck,
focused transition proof, native PostgreSQL migration proof, ancestry, exact
scope, and zero effects passed. P35 completed `ready_for_review` at
`a85aecc22b013d583589a67cf0cc9dfad6745aba`, implementation head
`6b92adbf893c45f4a767b8036ec41b52744cce4e`, state/handoff digest
`e524a2756fecb4ab6816e972211d858a729872f349459b0863754f3a72d01475`,
with three immutable steward requests assigned to later I36 checkpoints.

F03, F04, and F05 are independently verified and `ready_for_review`. Their
exact admitted interface sources are F03
`7c638131a0cab757657e95c4d2229a1573e4cde1`, F04
`4cc95c29c6012174595ba1821e0554aca8572e08`, and F05
`0656380bcfc50cc464dcea7588448dc724049599`. F04 deliberately uses the
interface-era checkpoint, excluding its later repository-only hardening from
this wave. F03's applied `F01-retired-auth-001` result is recorded at digest
`f557eacfce20aace5ea74ec926e09c949f7d80e660ac44021b445476d5f53f6e`.
F04/F05 migration and registration requests are assigned but unapplied.

I36 integrated F03/F04/F05 in exact order and published final integration
head `9782a4164662b8059a557c0969de9c35f54d0cf7`; all sources are ancestral,
typecheck and 49 focused tests pass, and zero steward/external effects were
performed. F01 acknowledged the applied F03 result and is `ready_for_review`
at `b5344992a43a735a9c66047fecd83f951651de27`. P15 is `ready_for_review`
at `c96b8c55c07e5283e762537934a6bf948833700e`, with implementation
`ab71afb032b8e004cc655e3e5f5a6b8286aec380`, exact interface digest
`2ebe108d2aa39a90908889bf9cf8f96cffb93d296e7ee9614e0d1bb5b351c3eb`,
state/handoff `cb8551031e184df2f727f1df5f54733ab02b1226fb1f00f11ed17b65e0c6f4ce`,
two assigned but unapplied steward requests, and zero effects.

P15 is ancestry-integrated at final head `01cdb992`. I36, P16, and P32
atomically claimed at `98f5689b`, `45649e52`, and `a174a5e7`; exact scopes,
bindings, and zero effects passed. I36 completed the ordered F06/P14 ancestry
wave at merge heads `f1ba79a9` and `41954f00`, with final integration metadata
`d35166838267711a514cf73822cd2ca49a3f3ded`; all checks and zero-effect
verification passed. P32 completed `ready_for_review` at `f4ae1c03`, with
interface source `6a33944a`, implementation `888af549`, exact contract digest
`76d0858798dbb7a14c93666ab9f0c647107d380464ec2d6b582657865eecf217`,
state/handoff `215a3e38...`, 21 focused tests, typecheck, and zero effects.
Its exact interface is queued for an atomic-claim-only I36 merge, and its three
steward requests are assigned but unapplied. P27 safely refused stale authority
after the C00 acquisition and is rebound to the same integration parent. Dispatch
the P27 and I36 atomic claims while P16 continues. Both claims are now exact:
P27 `4b55f314f86a0532387d5b6e0a6ace486858f7f1` and I36
`ffd63f4e3cdaa671f0c84645cf4b82edf8d95ac8`, each with only three task-local
runtime files and zero effects. The ready queue is consumed and the P32 merge
target CAS is rebound to `ffd63f4e`. Resume P27 implementation and I36's
P32-only ancestry merge. P16 stopped at unchanged head `45649e52` before any
further writes; its implementation remains only as a P16-owned dirty draft.
P16 consumed its renewal at exact head `f865439f9b37eba1a6dd0fcddc80f67b19c283a8`
with only three runtime files, preserving its owned draft unstaged. I36 merged
P32 at `7a176159` and published final integration head
`c4d042e94b3f7e779fd6bfd41127dd9576854805`; all checks passed with zero
effects and no steward action. P27 completed `ready_for_review` at `e1933d64`,
with interface `e706587b`, implementation `7d5edd68`, contract `788e150f...`,
interface state/handoff `d911136b...`, 10 focused tests, typecheck, and zero
effects. Its two steward requests are assigned but unapplied. The exact P27
interface is queued for atomic-claim-only I36 integration while P16 continues.
I36 consumed that atomic authorization at exact integration head
`8d90ca47c5396002a04ed0de53249ce8eac7ca52`. C00 rebound P27 merge item
`26b826f0-b0b1-4c03-8bf5-06af4ad5e7ce` to that target with canonical digest
`462a693c41463fc8cb3b7db2252c9e6c6ccf2c0061ec582d37b4640acc9edfe2`.
P16 completed `ready_for_review` at `72fca16b3a9cd82c666e293f8bfd7d84c30722a1`,
with interface `418ffcc5`, implementation `46b5c39a`, semantic contract
`95c177d5...`, 17 focused tests, typecheck, and zero effects. Its two steward
requests are assigned but unapplied. Resume I36 to merge only P27; authorize
P16 in a separate later integration transaction.
I36 merged P27 at exact two-parent head `91522295c4b6f7f3871cdd7085d16d7d3620e1ea`
and published final metadata `972fa43507d6d4391a86dd130a1c38a05820b2ce`.
The P27 source is ancestral, its exact scope/checks passed, P16 is absent, no
steward request was applied, and effects remain zero. C00 retired P27's merge
item and queued only P16 for fresh I36 atomic claim
`ff8bf935-3e65-4ed9-aa52-4032cfb5f7e6` from `972fa435`. Stop after that claim
so C00 can rebind the P16 optimistic target CAS before the merge.
I36 published that atomic claim at `47166ef026bb34842ec306cf7c2d2fc363773ad7`
with sole parent `972fa435` and exactly its three runtime files. P16 remains
absent. C00 rebound only merge item `cbf396c5-6b57-4ce6-b343-9a8c8fb3ae95`
to `47166ef0`; canonical payload is `e58c0de4886e2d9f40355848a6d3e3bdeb2db47ee6594d6f9d3ca7c931dc99c2`.
Resume I36 to merge only P16 and apply no steward request.
I36 merged P16 at exact two-parent head `387ca78ee33af7d2d4fd19d45a1b01981afaaad3`
and published final metadata `9ba92b070eedfa3756eff4f78fd328de72507a96`.
All scope, artifact, contract, typecheck, 17-test, lint, formatting, ancestry,
and zero-effect checks passed; no steward request was applied. The merge queue
is empty. C00 selected the three dependency-valid capacity lanes with the
largest immediate critical-path value: P18 embedded classroom, P19 content
ingest (unlocks P20), and P28 communication foundation (unlocks P29/P30).
Dispatch their exact ready entries from `9ba92b07`.
Before every later control mutation, acquire a
fresh serialized C00 lease against the exact fetched remote control head;
release it before waiting for workers.
Update C00 state, handoff, and this prompt at every phase; commit and normal-push
each checkpoint. Never implement product code, grant provider authority, or
force-push.
