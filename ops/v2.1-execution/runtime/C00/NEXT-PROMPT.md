Continue One Time v2.1 task C00 from its remote checkpoint.

Repository: shloimie-beep/onetimev2
Branch: codex/v21-control
Authoritative control ref: origin/codex/v21-control
Task packet: ops/v2.1-execution/tasks/C00.yaml
Task context: ops/v2.1-execution/contexts/C00-CONTEXT.md
Task state: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/TASK-STATE.yaml
Handoff: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/HANDOFF.md

Fetch remote refs and require the exact remote control head. Read
`CONTROL-STATE.yaml` and resume its first incomplete bootstrap phase. Verify
`LOCKED-SHA256SUMS.txt`, the current control/runtime digests, and the active
C00 lease. Reject any live foreign lease or non-fast-forward collision.

Bootstrap is operational and autonomous native-subagent orchestration is
enabled. The root C00 agent alone dispatches workers; child workers never spawn
product writers or edit control state. F01's interface is integrated at
`80c281b7ae5826ed2c6abe95ba68a033ffa52174`; F01 acknowledged both I36
rejection results at `dc991ef901617cc6d7e4fe780c53b4833172a0a2` and waits
for F03's remaining auth-steward result. F07 remains independently verified
and `ready_for_review`. P31 is ancestry-integrated at merge commit
`42b09dc598e0dfc17ada53b441e4cd487e126573`, with I36's final metadata
checkpoint at exact integration head
`eefca0644e57dca48609682cbc3e1b01992d286d`.

F02's corrected exact checkpoint is
`e4673ff1c2e621e26ac93034be245b280c4da4fa`, backed by implementation
`191dac288ea1721bdc0252bd012060ca974d2242`, interface digest
`c03e01d7e16bdc252b9964f1acfc60d40e772de98776023c20f7589e467b5ccd`,
and migration-2234 checksum
`d1352c5e46ae56ca549c9939ef739923109b4a0ab04f0d4df00c04dca71ccb22`.
C00 independently verified and admitted it. I36 ancestry-merged F02 at
`e6b49dff79911f3f11b6d2c0ce6a9a52d50bf7f4` and published exact final
integration head `d8b35b2aaa0dc4b687b6e88192c7eac6222ecdec`; typecheck,
focused transition proof, native PostgreSQL migration proof, ancestry, exact
scope, and zero effects passed. P35 completed `ready_for_review` at
`a85aecc22b013d583589a67cf0cc9dfad6745aba`, implementation head
`6b92adbf893c45f4a767b8036ec41b52744cce4e`, state/handoff digest
`e524a2756fecb4ab6816e972211d858a729872f349459b0863754f3a72d01475`,
with three immutable steward requests assigned to later I36 checkpoints.

F03, F04, and F05 are now ready from exact start `d8b35b2a`. Their claims are
`0b100424-7be3-4613-ae07-e7019d140a30`,
`38e6f374-86dc-4b78-9846-4c328455443c`, and
`8726d04b-b82f-4c2f-b071-57edab0b3b22`; payloads are `fa68fd0b…`,
`b04cb5f0…`, and `f58a652f…`. Dispatch those three only and hold control
fixed until every exact ready entry is consumed or safely refused. F03 must
evaluate assigned request `F01-retired-auth-001` at its ready-for-review
checkpoint.
Before every later control mutation, acquire a
fresh serialized C00 lease against the exact fetched remote control head;
release it before waiting for workers.
Update C00 state, handoff, and this prompt at every phase; commit and normal-push
each checkpoint. Never implement product code, grant provider authority, or
force-push.
