Continue One Time v2.1 task C00 from its remote checkpoint.

Repository: shloimie-beep/onetimev2
Branch: codex/v21-control
Authoritative control ref: origin/codex/v21-control
Task packet: ops/v2.1-execution/tasks/C00.yaml
Task context: ops/v2.1-execution/contexts/C00-CONTEXT.md
Task state: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/TASK-STATE.yaml
Handoff: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/HANDOFF.md

Fetch remote refs and require the exact remote control head. Read
`CONTROL-STATE.yaml` and resume its first incomplete bootstrap phase. Verify
`LOCKED-SHA256SUMS.txt`, the current control/runtime digests, and the active
C00 lease. Reject any live foreign lease or non-fast-forward collision.

Bootstrap is operational and autonomous native-subagent orchestration is
enabled. The root C00 agent alone dispatches workers; child workers never spawn
product writers or edit control state. The exact next scheduling action is to
spawn one F01 worker from ready payload
`02778740dc1c287edf20b08699ab1d83d4b1dd131026737c4a75759d90c30af2`,
verify its pushed branch evidence, and dispatch I36 only after admissible
integration work is queued. Before every later control mutation, acquire a
fresh serialized C00 lease against the exact fetched remote control head;
release it before waiting for workers.
Update C00 state, handoff, and this prompt at every phase; commit and normal-push
each checkpoint. Never implement product code, grant provider authority, or
force-push.
