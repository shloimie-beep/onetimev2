Continue One Time v2.1 task C00 from its remote checkpoint.

Repository: shloimie-beep/onetimev2
Branch: codex/v21-control
Authoritative control ref: origin/codex/v21-control
Task packet: ops/v2.1-execution/tasks/C00.yaml
Task context: ops/v2.1-execution/contexts/C00-CONTEXT.md
Task state: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/TASK-STATE.yaml
Handoff: ops/v2.1-execution/runtime/C00/HANDOFF.md

Fetch remote refs and require the exact remote control head. Read
`CONTROL-STATE.yaml` and resume its first incomplete bootstrap phase. Verify
`LOCKED-SHA256SUMS.txt`, the current control/runtime digests, and the active
C00 lease. Reject any live foreign lease or non-fast-forward collision.

Bootstrap is operational and autonomous native-subagent orchestration is
enabled. The root C00 agent alone dispatches workers; child workers never spawn
product writers or edit control state. F01's interface is integrated at
`80c281b7ae5826ed2c6abe95ba68a033ffa52174`; F01 acknowledged both I36
rejection results at `dc991ef901617cc6d7e4fe780c53b4833172a0a2` and waits
for F03's remaining auth-steward result. F07 remains independently verified
and `ready_for_review`. P31 is ancestry-integrated at merge commit
`42b09dc598e0dfc17ada53b441e4cd487e126573`, with I36's final metadata
checkpoint at exact integration head
`eefca0644e57dca48609682cbc3e1b01992d286d`.

F02's corrected exact checkpoint is
`e4673ff1c2e621e26ac93034be245b280c4da4fa`, backed by implementation
`191dac288ea1721bdc0252bd012060ca974d2242`, interface digest
`c03e01d7e16bdc252b9964f1acfc60d40e772de98776023c20f7589e467b5ccd`,
and migration-2234 checksum
`d1352c5e46ae56ca549c9939ef739923109b4a0ab04f0d4df00c04dca71ccb22`.
C00 independently verified and admitted it. I36 is resume-ready from
`eefca064` under claim `8d31181a-cfe8-493e-b7ce-4ea867da9581`, ready
payload `9758c3f53dcecec282041590350bdf8ec2ac2283357fa5893b72786824703aa4`,
and F02-only merge item `95985f2c-410b-461b-9360-549591ef624e` with
payload `1cf403e537176b60462e186b9f3ec5edecf8eb216707b2ff5b25e0df1d5a5d71`.
P35 is ready from the same start head under claim
`9ee0d8f8-944d-47f2-b67a-54cb333cc29d` and payload
`7f53c07831911d21d07ebe7f3067f5cd046087cb89841b19c1a1a37ad901d27f`.
Hold control fixed until both exact ready entries are consumed or safely
refused. After F02 integrates, recalculate and authorize the newly unblocked
critical-path lanes.
Before every later control mutation, acquire a
fresh serialized C00 lease against the exact fetched remote control head;
release it before waiting for workers.
Update C00 state, handoff, and this prompt at every phase; commit and normal-push
each checkpoint. Never implement product code, grant provider authority, or
force-push.
