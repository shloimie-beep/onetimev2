## Completed behavior

Verified repository identity, PR #130's exact reviewed head, archive structure,
and every delivery checksum. Installed the complete v2.1 package, added the
v2.1 authority block to `AGENTS.md`, seeded the serialized controller claim,
validated that a fresh agent reaches v2.1 before historical status sources,
and passed the normal control-branch creation push permission canary.
The canonical verify baseline was measured in a detached worktree at the exact
reviewed head: secret scanning passed and Prettier reported 1,736 files before
the chained command stopped.

## Remaining work

Validate and checkpoint each remaining bootstrap phase, measure the repository
baseline, create the integration branch, initialize exact F01/I36 ready state,
mark the controller operational, and release the controller lease.

## Exact next action

Measure the actual `npm run verify` baseline with source, dependency lock,
toolchain/runtime, and environment fingerprints, then create the integration
branch from the committed bootstrap checkpoint.

## Verification

- Delivery manifest: 214/214 entries passed.
- Package inventory: 46 tasks, 46 contexts, 46 prompts, 16 source-spec files.
- Baseline failure fingerprint: `049be15daaa0ab5ff3bacc9743c60884002e6e856341feafcbc7a1a78cfc5d4b`.
- No provider or product effect was attempted.

## Blockers, deviations, and recovery

None. The attached `(1)` ZIP and the exact-basename ZIP were byte-identical;
the isolated staging area contains only the required exact-basename package.
